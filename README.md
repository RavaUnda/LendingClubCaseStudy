## Objectives
- Primary objective of this case study is to reduce the ***'Credit Loss'***. Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as ***'charged-off'*** are the ***'defaulters'***. 
- In this exercise, we are trying to identify these risky applicants who has a high chance to ***'default'***. Using EDA we will understand the ***'driving factors'*** behind loan defaults.
- Loan data set between 2007 and 2011 are used to perform the Data Analysis.
